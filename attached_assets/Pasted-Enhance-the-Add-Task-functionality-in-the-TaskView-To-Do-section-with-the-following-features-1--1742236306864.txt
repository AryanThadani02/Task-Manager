Enhance the 'Add Task' functionality in the TaskView To-Do section with the following features:

1. Add Task Button:
Place an 'Add Task' button at the top of the To-Do section.
When clicked, it should expand an input form directly under the respective column headers:
Task Title
Due Date
Status (To-Do, In-Progress, Completed)
Category
2. Task Input Fields:
Task Title:

A text input field where users can enter the task name.
It should be a required field.
Due Date Picker:

Allow users to select a due date for the task.
Restrict past dates so that users can only pick todayâ€™s date or future dates.
Status Dropdown:

Provide a dropdown menu with three options: To-Do, In-Progress, Completed.
Users should be able to select the task status while creating it, instead of restricting it to just "To-Do".
The selected status should determine where the task appears in the UI.
Category Selection:

Provide a dropdown or tag selector where users can choose from predefined categories (e.g., Work, Personal, etc.).
Allow users to select one or multiple categories.
3. Action Buttons:
Add Button:

Clicking this should save the task to Firebase and display it in the appropriate section based on the selected status.
The task should appear immediately in the UI without requiring a refresh.
Cancel Button:

Clicking this should close the input form without saving any data.
4. Firebase Integration:
Ensure the newly added task is stored in Firebase with all the correct details (Title, Due Date, Status, and Category).
Tasks should be dynamically rendered in the correct section based on the selected status.
5. UI & UX Considerations:
Keep the design clean and consistent with the existing UI.
Ensure smooth transitions when expanding and collapsing the input form.
Validate required fields to prevent empty submissions.
If a task is created under the wrong status, users should still be able to move it using drag-and-drop functionality.
By implementing these changes, users will have more flexibility when adding tasks while maintaining an intuitive and user-friendly experience.
